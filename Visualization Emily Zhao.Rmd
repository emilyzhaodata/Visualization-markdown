#Description of the data

#The dataset I am using is to measure whether voters want democrats or republicans in congress in 2022. The data measures the number of people voted for democrats or republicans from various channels/surveys. I want to answer research questions on how the political interest for different parties differentiate from multi channels. It has both continuous and categorical data, and in csv format with comma delimited.The normal tools to open are excel and R.

Section 2
```{r read data, include = TRUE}
#I used the read csv function from readr package
data<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\emily.zhao\\Documents\\generic_ballot_polls.csv")

```

Section 3
```{r , include = TRUE}

#I leave the columns I want to keep as only channels, sponsors, date and numbers of voters
data_selected<-data%>%select(pollster,sponsors,fte_grade,start_date,end_date,created_at,dem,rep,sample_size,methodology)

#rename some columns 
data_selected <- data_selected %>% rename(sponsor = sponsors, grade = fte_grade)

```

Section 4


```{r , include = TRUE}

#This dataframe has 367 rows and 10 columns. The names of the columns and a brief description of each are in the table below:

```


```{r, include = TRUE}
#install.packages("knitr")
library(knitr)
kable(data_selected)
data<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\emily.zhao\\Documents\\generic_ballot_polls.csv")
description<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\emily.zhao\\Documents\\Description.csv")
description <- description %>% rename(Columns = Ã¯..Columns)
kable(description)
```

Section 5 

```{r, include = TRUE}

data_selected<-data_selected%>%select(pollster,dem,rep)

summary(data_selected$dem)
summary(data_selected$rep)


```
Visualization 1- Summary plot
This provides the summary stats of column in my data like mean, min, max values.

```{r, include = TRUE}
# Basic plot
library(ggpubr)

summary.stats <- data_selected %>%select(dem,pollster)%>%
  get_summary_stats(type = "common")


ggsummarytable(
  summary.stats, x = "dem", y = c("n", "min","median", "max","iqr","sd","se","ci"),
  ggtheme = theme_bw()
)


```

Group by pollster to see rankings and data summary

```{r, include = TRUE}

data_group<-data_selected%>%group_by(pollster) %>%
  summarise(democrat=sum(dem),republican=sum(rep))

summary(data_group$democrat)
sum(is.na(data_group$democrat))

summary(data_group$republican)
sum(is.na(data_group$republican))

democrat_summary<- c(34,3545,320.64,0)
republican_summary<- c(29,3145,314.90,0)

democrat_summary
republican_summary

data_group$democrat<-round(data_group$democrat, digits = 0)
data_group$republican<-round(data_group$republican, digits = 0)

kable(data_group)

```

Visualization 2- Bar Plot
This shows the numbers of voters by channel by party.

```{r, include = TRUE}

#data_group$democrat<-as.factor(data_group$democrat)
#data_group$democrat<-desc(data_group$democrat)


data_group%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=democrat,y=pollster))+
  geom_col()
